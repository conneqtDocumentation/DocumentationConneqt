# Displays
When viewing assets of an asset type, there are 5 types of display:
- Date and time
- Timeline
- Map
- Table
- Tiles

Each type of display also has its own options to further customize the display


### Date and time / Timeline:
Date and time and Timeline will show a calendar or timeline where assets can be placed based on their start and end date/time (see standard properties) or other dates added to the asset. The main difference between these displays is the time that an asset takes, where date and time ranges from a few minutes to months, timeline ranges from weeks to a year.
