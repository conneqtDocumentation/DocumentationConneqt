# User settings
In the user settings, settings specific to the user can be set. These can’t be changed by the tenant administrators.

The display languages currently supported are English (US), English (UK) and Dutch. In the ‘menu’ option, the menu that is displayed on the left side of the screen can be chosen from the created menus the user can access. In the ‘home screen’ option, the dashboard that the user will see once they start Conneqt can be chosen from the list of dashboards the user can access. The ‘color scheme’ changes the theme of Conneqt. Under ‘tenant management’ the user can create, open, leave and if they have the rights, delete a tenant. ‘Change password’ allows the user to change their password and ‘Two-factor authentication’ allows for 2FA to be set up.
