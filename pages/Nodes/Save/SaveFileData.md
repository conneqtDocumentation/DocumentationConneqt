# Save file data to conneqt

This node uploads a binary array file to conneqt. The node results in a reference to that copy, which is usable as a property value. It is recommended to use the [Upload image](https://github.com/conneqtDocumentation/connectDocumentation/blob/main/Nodes/UserInterface/ImageUpload.md) UI node for regular files.

### Node properties:

##### Data
The string of binary data to be saved.

##### Node Expression
Do not change.

### Return:
This node will return a reference string to the file.
