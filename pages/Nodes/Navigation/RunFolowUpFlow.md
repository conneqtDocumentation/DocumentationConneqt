# Run folow up flow
Run a follow up Flow once this Flow has finished. Note that the node cannot be connected to the green dot of a node that creates an UI element.

### Node properties
##### Action
Changing this is not recommended
##### Parameter
The new Flow that is triggered.
##### Referencing:
This is an end node, once this node is triggered the current Flow stops. Therefore it is not possible to reference the node.
