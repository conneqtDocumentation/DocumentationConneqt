# RunSubflow
Execute another flow inside the current flow. Unlike the dynamic subflow, this flow does not use inputs. It merely triggers the flow and waits for an output.

### Node properties
##### FlowId
The identifier of the flow to execute.

##### Outputs
This node outputs the output of the executed flow. An output can be created by adding a ‘Result action’  node set to output to the executed flow. Multiple outputs can be generated this way.
