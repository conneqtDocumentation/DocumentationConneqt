### Node properties
##### Label

##### badge
Script that denotes what text or number shows on the badge of the button.
##### Visible:

##### Icon
An icon to be displayed left of the text of the button
##### Color
The color of the text.
##### FontSize
The size of the text
##### Location

This can also reference other nodes. E.g. we are using a ‘Get geo-location’ node then we use 

    return Nodes.Location.coordinates[1] + ',' + Nodes.Location.coordinates[0]
