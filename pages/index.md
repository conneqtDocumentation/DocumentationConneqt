# Welcome to the conneqt documentation

Conneqt is a program designed for creating managing and/or administrative systems, but can be used to other ends too. Within a tennant (a conneqt workspace), data is stored in assets. The form of, and what kind of data is stored in these assets is determined by the asset's asset type. This data can then be manipulated by flows, a visual based coding system. 

For information on specific topics, please consult their respective pages.

### Some usefull pages:

[Asset types](https://github.com/conneqtDocumentation/connectDocumentation/blob/main/Assettypes.md): Asset types are the foundation of any tennant.

[Dashboards](https://github.com/conneqtDocumentation/connectDocumentation/blob/main/Dashboards.md): Dashboards are the place where all the information of a tennant is gathered.

[Flows](https://github.com/conneqtDocumentation/connectDocumentation/blob/main/Flows.md): Flows are the building blocks of a tennant.

[Widgets](https://github.com/conneqtDocumentation/connectDocumentation/blob/main/Widgets.md): Widgets are the main way to display information.

[Report a problem with the documentation](https://api-test.conneqt.com/flow/pwa/?otp=bc84e2fa-9ffd-432c-aeb6-99fef2e38d0a): If there is a part of the documentation is unclear, contains and error or is outdated, we kindly ask you to file a ticket so that we may update our documentation.
