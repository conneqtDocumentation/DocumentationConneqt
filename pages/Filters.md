# Filters
Filters allow us to filter on certain asset types or assets. Depending on the type of the property you are filtering on, different filter options will be available. Opening the filter menu shows a list of all the filters in the tenant. Clicking a filter shows all the relevant data.
When creating a new filter, first the asset and property filters are set using the below listed filter options. After that a name can be given to a filter, as well as a scope. The scope can be set to three different modes:
- Single use: the filter can only be used in the place it was created
- Reusable: the filter can be used multiple times
- Main menu: the filter can be used multiple times but is listed under the main menu scope when searching filters. This is useful to separate important filters from general filters

All created filters can be found on the Filter page. Selecting a filter listed shows all the filters settings, as well as a neat list of all the sub filters used in the filter. It also lists where and how many times the filter is referenced

Pressing the ![Expression](Documentation/Filters/18.png) symbol allows for more advanced filters to be written using java-script. Where ‘&&’ means ‘and’, || means ‘or’ and ‘!’ means ‘not’.
When creating a filter in a view:

![Save filter](Documentation/Filters/19.png) allows you to save the filter to be used later in widgets (see widgets)

![Reset](Documentation/Filters/20.png) clears all filter settings.
