# Modules
Modules allow for exporting part of a tenant for others to use. Creating a module is as simple as clicking the ‘Create Module’ button. Anything can then be moved into the module by clicking the move button ![Two arrows pointing in opposing directions](Documentation/Modules/0.png) and selecting the module. Openable items can be opened by clicking the open button ![Conneqts standard link button, a square with an arrow pointing out of it.](Documentation/Modules/1.png) . A module can be deleted by pressing the bin button ![A red bin](Documentation/Modules/2.png) , renamed with the rename button ![A pencil with a line](Documentation/Modules/3.png), a new version can be created using the Create version button ![A cardboard box with a plus](Documentation/Modules/4.png)  and a sharable token can be made using the generate token button ![A fishing hook](Documentation/Modules/5.png).

To share a module, it needs a version. When a version is made, it shows all the existing and changed dependencies to items outside the module, and it shows the dependencies of all the items in the module in a dependency graph. Creating a sharable token will generate a string of numbers and letters, this is automatically copied to the clipboard.

A module can be installed by pasting a share token into the field that appears after clicking the ‘install module version’ button. When the creator of the module then creates a new version, the module can be updated by clicking the update version button ![An arrow pointing into its own end.
